## Note from the Developer

I noticed that my name is not included in the list of students who submitted the EZ assignment via Google Docs. However, I would like to clarify that I have completed and submitted this project independently out of personal curiosity and enthusiasm.

I have a strong understanding of Django backend development, and this project has been implemented using best practices. If the company or the form owner is open to reviewing additional submissions, I would be honored if my work could be considered, and I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to be allowed for the interview process.

For any queries or further communication, feel free to reach out to me at **saxenaadity381@gmail.com**.
